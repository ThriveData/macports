description			Asynchronous DNS resolver library
long_description	libasr is a free, simple and portable asynchronous resolver library. It allows to run dns queries and perform hostname resolutions in a fully asynchronous fashion. The implementation is thread-less, fork-less, and does not make use of signals or other "tricks" that might get in the developer's way.
